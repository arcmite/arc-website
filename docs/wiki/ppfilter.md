# Post-Processing Filters

> <Badge type="danger" text="Outdated"/> <Badge type="warning" text="Under Review"/>

A Post-Processing Filter, or PPFilter, is a configuration file (`.ini`) that controls the final look of the game in real-time. It adjusts everything from color grading and contrast to advanced effects like bloom, lens flare, and depth of field. It is the primary tool for achieving a specific visual style in Assetto Corsa.

## How It Works

The filter works by applying a series of shader effects after the 3D scene has been rendered but before it is displayed on your screen.
